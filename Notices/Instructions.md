Inorder to update the content of your department, you can either work directly on the browser or you may `clone` the repository to your system and work on any text editor (such as atom, visual studio, etc; instead of browser).`Cloning Process:` Optionl if anyone wants to save the whole newsletter code in their system and wish to work on any text editor <br>
You will get a `Welcome Screen`, click on the green `Code` button near the top right of the page. You’ll see a URL under the "Clone" section. You will have two options:<br>

6. In the repository, you will see a folder named `Content`.

7. Click on it, and find another sub-folder with the name of your Department (Eg: CE, CSE, ME, etc.). *Let us say, if your department is Computer Science And Engineering, then you will have to make changes **ONLY** in the folder named `CSE`.* **Kindly DO NOT delete / edit any other folder / file.**

8. In the folder of your respective department, you will find a folder named `Images` and a file named `x.md` where x is abbreviation of your department, like CSE.md for Computer Science And Engineering.

9. Use the `Images` folder to keep photographs/Images to be published in Newsletter. You are free to make sub-folders for different set of images like Events, Faculty, etc.
